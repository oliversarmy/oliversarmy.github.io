title: Majoric System - Major Dominic System

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/crystal.jpg)

The Major System and Dominic System are mnemonic systems for remembering number sequences. The Majoric System combines these two systems with the purpose of making it more flexible than the Dominic system and with a more intuitive letter ordering and rule logic compared to the Major system.

## Dominic System

The Dominic system was invented by memory champion, Dominic O'Brien. It assigns the initials and name of a memorable person or character, to a two digit number from 00 to 99.

### Dominic character positions
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  s  g  h  n  o
```

This uses alphabetical ordering, except for letters s, n and o.

## Major System

The Major System replaces numbers with consonant sounds. The system is very
powerful and complex.

### Major character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
t  n  m  r  l  j  c  v  p  s
d              sh k  f  b  z
th             ch g  ph
                  q
                  ck
```

## Combine Dominic System and Major System

Taking inspiration from the Dominic System, start with an alphabetical ordering for the first 9 Letters. Unlike the Major system, vowels are significant. It is useful to have a base of alphabetical ordering, especially when learning the system

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0   (base alphabetical encodings)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i
```

Next, where theres no conflict, add the Major system letter groupings on top of this alphabetical ordering.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0   (partial encodings)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k     l  v           z
      q
```
As a quick explanation (where the letter positions is the same as the Major
System)

* The letter T has one vertical stroke, just like a 1.
* The letter L is the roman numeral for 50 ("Live at 5").
* Zero begins with Z, which sounds like a voiced S (voiced and voiceless pair).

An explanation where the mappings have moved:

* Lower case p looks like a mirror image of b.
* k can sound very like c. q starts with a "k" sound.
* v sounds like a voiced f

Finally, taking into account letter frequencies, place the remaining letters.

* The letter n is the first letter of nine.
* Lower case r looks like a mirror image of 7.
* Lower case m looks like an incomplete 8 on its side.
* The letter w has four lines forming it's shape.
* The letter o looks like a 0.
* The letter u looks like a rounded v.
* The letter j sound is sometimes made by the letter g.
* The letters x and y are unassigned and don't change the number value of a word.

This leads to the following Majoric character positons:

## Majoric character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k  w  l  v  r  m  n  z
      q        u  j        o
```

## Majoric - Basic Word Rules

1. Vowels, a e i o u, are significant, but, only when they start a word, and in most cases, only the first vowel. (e.g age is 17, not 175).
1. Double letters are disregarded when not pronounced separately (e.g call - 35, however midday - 844).
1. The letter sequence "ck" is treated the same as "k". The letter sequence "ph"
   is treated as "f" (unless the letters straddle a compound word).

## Majoric - Advanced Word Rules

1. Prefixes starting with "un" are very common and treated as a single 6. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "unify" is encoded as 696 and "unborn" is encoded as 627.
1. Prefixes starting with "in" are very common and treated as a single 9. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "inability" is encoded as 91251.
1. Phonetic changes: If a letter grouping feels like a completely different letter grouping, change it (e.g. caught - 3781 sounds like cau/t/ - 31 (note: how far to take this is a personal choice).
1. As an alternative (or in addition) to doing general phonetic changes, don't use words
   with problematic spelling like cauGHt.

## Majoric - Name, Action, Object Rules (for 2 digit numbers)

7. Names are created in the same ways as the Dominic system, with the first
  letter of the names (i.e. first and last name) representing a one digit number (and thus a two digit number when combined).
1. Actions and objects are created in a similar way as the Major system,
but with words of any length.
Only the first two significant letters are used, when actions and objects are being associated with a person representing a two digit number (as is the case in the example below).

### Generating Names, Actions, Object

[Generate Names by initials](http://peoplebyinitials.com/p/dominic-number-memory-system)

[Generate Majoric Actions and Objects](http://olivers.army/MajoricListTo999/)

## Majoric Example

I'm going to limit the example to the following letters to generate peoples names.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  n  s
```

Thus, apart from letters n and s, all letters are in alphabetical ordering. This
is for the names only. The actions and objects can use all available letters.

For example, the actor Sandra Bullock SPlits OBelisk, encodes 02. The word
"obelisk" encodes 02 (rather than 0250) in this instance, because it's linked to Sandra Bullock and it's in a 2 digit naming convention (same for the word splits). If we were using a 3 digit naming convention, it would encode 3 digits!

My apologies to anyone I offend with the actions on objects :)
