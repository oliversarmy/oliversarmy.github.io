## Majoric Digital letters

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  o  <-- alphabetical digital letters
t  p  k  w  l  v  j  m  n  s  <-- phonetic and logical groups
      q        u  r        z
```

The Majoric System is a spelling based mnemonic system for remembering number sequences, with phonetic groups and rules to minimise spelling issues.

The Majoric system has a base alphabetical ordering. A vowel that starts
a word encodes a digit. This expands on the Dominic system.

In the Majoric system the letters of a word unambiguously encode numbers, unlike the Major system where every person can perceive different sounds and numbers.

There is a Person-Action-Object (PAO) example at the end of this post and links, so you can choose your own person as well as action and object words.

## Phonetic and logical groups

Where the letter position is the same as Major/Dominic System

* The letter T has one vertical stroke, just like a 1.
* The letter L is the roman numeral for 50.
* Zero begins with Z, which is phonetically similar to S.
* The letter O looks like a 0.

Where the letter is placed because of its phonetics

* k can sound like c. q starts with a k sound.
* j can get confused with g when they have the same sound.
* v is phonetically similar to f.
* p is phonetically similar to b (and mirror image).

Where the letter is placed based on letter frequency

* The letter n is the first letter of nine.
* Lower case m looks like an incomplete 8 on its side.
* Lower case r looks like a mirror image of 7.
* The letter w has four lines forming it's shape.
* The letter u looks like a rounded v.

The letters x and y are unassigned and don't change the number value of a word.

This leads to the following Majoric character positions:

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  o
t  p  k  w  l  v  j  m  n  s
      q        u  r        z
```

## Basic word rules

1. Within a word, double letters are treated as a single letter. The letter sequence "ck" is treated as a single "k".
1. Vowels, a e i o u, are significant, but (normally) only the first vowel at the start of a word (e.g age is 17, not 175).

## Advanced word rules

1. Prefixes starting with "un" are very common and treated as a single 6. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "unify" is encoded as 696 and "unborn" is encoded as 6279.
1. Prefixes starting with "in" are very common and treated as a single 9. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "inability" is encoded as 91251.

## Name, Action, Object rules

7. Names are associated with a number of digits. For example, assign the initials of the first and last name
   to create a two digit sequence (i.e. Dominic System).
1. Actions and objects are created in a similar way as the Major system, but with words of any length. The number of significant digital letters is restricted to the digits assigned to the name (e.g. if Arnold Schwarzenegger is number 10, his action TaSers, has two digital letters).

#### Generating Names, Actions, Object

[Find Names by initials](http://peoplebyinitials.com/p/dominic-number-memory-system)

[Find Majoric Actions and Objects](http://olivers.army/MajoricListTo999/)

## Example

I'm going to limit the example to the following letters to generate peoples names.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  n  s
```

Thus, apart from letters n and s, all letters are in alphabetical ordering. This
is for the names only. The actions and objects can use all available letters.
e.g. Sandra Bullock SPlits OBelisk, encodes 02.

I've chosen actions and objects that are different from each other, easy to visualize and memorable to me,
rather than trying to constrain them to indicate something about the person
(though, in some cases they do).

My apologies to anyone I offend with the actions on objects :)

## Jacks / One digit encodings

The following are one digit encodings, for cases where two digits is one too
many. Only, the letter of the second name constrains the actions and objects. The
letter of the first name is redundant, but can be used as "Jack" in
cards.

```
0,JS,Jason Statham, steamrolls, submarine
1,JA,Jessica Alba, arouses, asteroid
2,JB,Justin Bieber, bites, bone
3,JC,Jenna Coleman, chases, quidditch

## Appendix

### Dominic System

The Dominic system was invented by memory champion, Dominic O'Brien. It assigns the initials and name of a memorable person or character, to a two digit number from 00 to 99.

#### Dominic letter positions
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  s  g  h  n  o
```

This uses alphabetical ordering, except for letters s, n and o.

### Major System

The Major System replaces numbers with consonant sounds. The system is
phonetic, very powerful, complex and takes time to learn.

#### Major phonetic character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
t  n  m  r  l  j  c  v  p  s
d              sh k  f  b  z
th             ch g  ph
                  q
                  ck
```

### Combining Dominic System and Major System

Taking inspiration from the Dominic System, start with an alphabetical letter ordering for the first 9 letters. Unlike the Major system, vowels are significant. The alphabetical ordering, helps when learning the system

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0   (base alphabetical encodings)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i
```

Next, where theres no conflict, add the Major system letter groupings on top of this alphabetical ordering.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0   (partial encodings)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k     l  v           z
      q
```
