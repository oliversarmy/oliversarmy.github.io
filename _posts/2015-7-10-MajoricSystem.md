## Majoric digital letters

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s  <-- alphabetical digital letters
t  p  k  w  l  v  r  m  n  z  <-- phonetic and logical groups
      q        u           o
               j
```

The Majoric System is a mnemonic system for remembering number sequences.

It combines the Major and Dominic systems, with the purpose of making it much more flexible than the Dominic system and with a more intuitive letter ordering, rule logic and better word distribution, compared to the Major system.

In the Majoric system, vowels are significant. A vowel which starts a word, directly encodes a digit. This makes it a lot easier for beginners to form words starting with vowels, and in most cases a two digit number just require the first 2 letters of a word.

The Majoric system (unlike the Major) can be used as a spelling based or phonic based system. This is important as some people visualize word spelling rather than sound it out.

There is a Person-Action-Object (PAO) example at the end of this post and links, so you can choose your own person as well as action and object words.


## History

### Dominic System

The Dominic system was invented by memory champion, Dominic O'Brien. It assigns the initials and name of a memorable person or character, to a two digit number from 00 to 99.

#### Dominic letter positions
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  s  g  h  n  o
```

This uses alphabetical ordering, except for letters s, n and o.

### Major System

The Major System replaces numbers with consonant sounds. The system is
phonetic, very powerful, complex and takes time to learn.

#### Major phonetic character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
t  n  m  r  l  j  c  v  p  s
d              sh k  f  b  z
th             ch g  ph
                  q
                  ck
```

## Combine Dominic System and Major System

Taking inspiration from the Dominic System, start with an alphabetical letter ordering for the first 9 letters. Unlike the Major system, vowels are significant. The alphabetical ordering, helps when learning the system

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0   (base alphabetical encodings)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i
```

Next, where theres no conflict, add the Major system letter groupings on top of this alphabetical ordering.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0   (partial encodings)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k     l  v           z
      q
```

Next finalize the letter placement:

## Majoric digital letter, explanations

Where the letter position is the same as the Major System:

* The letter T has one vertical stroke, just like a 1.
* The letter L is the roman numeral for 50 ("Live at 5").
* Zero begins with Z, which is phonetically similar to S.

Where the letter have has moved to a different digit:

* Lower case p looks like a mirror image of b.
* k can sound very like c. q starts with a /k/ sound.
* v is phonetically similar to f

Taking into account letter frequencies, the remaining letters:

* The letter n is the first letter of nine.
* Lower case r looks like a mirror image of 7.
* Lower case m looks like an incomplete 8 on its side.
* The letter w has four lines forming it's shape.
* The letter o looks like a 0 (same as Dominic System).
* The letter u looks like a rounded v.
* The letter j looks like the tail of f.
* The letters x and y are unassigned and don't change the number value of a word.

This leads to the following Majoric character positions:

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k  w  l  v  r  m  n  z
      q        u           o
               j
```

## Majoric - Basic Word Rules

1. Vowels, a e i o u, are significant, but, only when they start a word, and in most cases, only the first vowel. (e.g age is 17, not 175).
1. Double letters are disregarded when not pronounced separately (e.g call - 35, however midday - 844).
1. The letter sequence "ck" is treated the same as "k" (this is very similar to a double letter sequence).

## Majoric - Advanced Word Rules

1. Words may not begin with the letters "Y" or "X" as these words are reserved.
1. Only the first three digital letters in a word are potentially significant
   (e.g "politics" base encoding is 251, not 25130).
   The reason is, with this system to a small extent (and the Major System, to a larger extent) there is not enough coverage in
   English to always find words to express 000 - 999. In addition, phonetic
   issues are minimised by not encoding the whole word.
1. Prefixes starting with "un" are very common and treated as a single 6. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "unify" is encoded as 696 and "unborn" is encoded as 627.
1. Prefixes starting with "in" are very common and treated as a single 9. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "inability" is encoded as 912 (note: rule maximum 3 digital characters).

## Majoric -  Phonetic Rules

You can use a spelling based system or apply phonetics. Some people may visualise the spelling of a word, (especially the first few characters).

In the PAO example given below with characters from 00 to 99, there are 100
characters, 100 actions and 100 objects. The actions and objects have just two
significant digital letters, so thats 400 digital letters
in total.

So, i'ts easy to choose words that cause no phonetic confusion.  However, if you want:

1. If a letter grouping feels to you, like a completely different letter grouping, change it (e.g. caught - 378 sounds like cau/t/ - 31 (note: how far to take this is a personal choice).

## Majoric - Name, Action, Object Rules (for 2 digit numbers)

7. Names are created in the same ways as the Dominic system, with the first
  letter of the names (i.e. first and last name) representing a one digit number (and thus a two digit number when combined).
1. Actions and objects are created in a similar way as the Major system,
but with words of any length.  As, we are encoding 2 digit numbers, only the first two digital letters are used. The persons, actions and objects, are then associated with and represent the the two digit number, no matter what the context.

### Generating Names, Actions, Object

[Generate Names by initials](http://peoplebyinitials.com/p/dominic-number-memory-system)

[Generate Majoric Actions and Objects](http://olivers.army/MajoricListTo999/)

## Majoric Example

I'm going to limit the example to the following letters to generate peoples names.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  n  s
```

Thus, apart from letters n and s, all letters are in alphabetical ordering. This
is for the names only. The actions and objects can use all available letters.

For example, the actor Sandra Bullock SPlits OBelisk, encodes 02. The word
"obelisk" encodes 02 because it's linked to Sandra Bullock and it's in a 2 digit naming convention (same for the word splits). If we were using a 3 digit naming convention, and the word had not already been assigned, it could encode 3 digits!

I've chosen actions and objects that are different from each other, easy to visualize and memorable to me,
rather than trying to constrain them to indicate something about the person
(though, in some cases they do).

My apologies to anyone I offend with the actions on objects :)

## Jacks / One digit encodings

The following are one digit encodings, for cases where two digits is one too
many. Only, the letter of the second name constrains the actions and objects. The
letter of the first name is redundant, but can be used as "Jack" in
cards.
