title: Majoric System English List - 00 to 99
---

These are exact matches for the numbers 00 to 99. If you are using the system to pair
words to names (like in the Dominic System), I suggest you use words in the 000
to 999 list, as it will give you many more name choices (e.g. If you are looking
for 01, you can use words from 010 to 019)

note: This is not a list for the Major System!
