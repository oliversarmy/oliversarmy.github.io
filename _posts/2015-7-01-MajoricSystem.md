title: Majoric - Major Dominic System
---
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/crystal.jpg)

The Major System and Dominic System are mnemonic systems for remembering number sequences. The Major Dominic is an attempt to combine the strengths of each system.

## Dominic System

The Dominic system was invented by memory champion, Dominic O'Brien. It assigns the initials and name of a memorable person or character, to a two digit number from 00 to 99.

## Dominic character positions
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  s  g  h  n  o
```

This uses alphabetical ordering, except for letters s, n and o.

## Major System

The Major System replaces numbers with consonant sounds. The system is very
powerful and complex.

## Major character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
t  n  m  r  l  j  c  v  p  s
d              sh k  f  b  z
th             ch g  ph
                  q
                  ck
```

## Combine Dominic System and Major System

Lets combine the Major system and Dominic system, with a bit of a twist.
First start with an alphabetical ordering for the first 9 mappings.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i
```

Next, add the Major system letter groupings on top of this alphabetical ordering.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k     l  v           z
      q
```

Finally, taking into account letter frequencies, make up reasons why the remaining letters are placed.

* The letter n starts nine.
* Lower case r looks a bit like a mirror image of 7.
* Lower case m looks like an incomplete 8 on its side.
* The letter w has four lines forming it.
* The letter o gets its Dominic system position.
* The letter u looks a bit like a v.
* The letter j goes with the g.
* Letters x and y are unassigned and don't change the number value of a word.

## Majoric character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k  w  l  v  r  m  n  z
      q        u  j        o
```

## Majoric - Rules

1. Double letters are disregarded when not pronounced separately.
2. If the first letter is a consonant, the second letter doesn't count (e.g.
  blob is 22 not 252).
3. When a consonant grouping occurs that modifies the sound of the inital letter (e.g. br, cl, gr, ll, rs, sh, st, ...),  only the first letter is significant. Thus the word "crash" encodes number 30 (note: this encompasses rules 1 and 2).
4. Vowels, a e i o u are significant, but, only when they start a word and only
  the first vowel. (e.g age is 17, not 175)
5. Names are created in the same ways as the Dominic system, with the first
  letter of each name representing the number.
6. Actions and objects are created in a similar way as the Major system,
but with words of any length.
Only the first two significant letters are used, when actions and objects are being associated with a person representing a two digit number (as is the case in the example below).


## Generating Names

[Generate Names by initials](http://peoplebyinitials.com/p/dominic-number-memory-system)

## Majoric Example

I'm going to use the following letters to generate peoples names

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  n  s
```

Thus, apart from letters n and s, all letters are in their natural ordering:

My apologies to anyone I offend with the actions on objects :)
