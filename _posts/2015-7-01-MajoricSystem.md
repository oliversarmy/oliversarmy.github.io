title: Majoric System - Major Dominic System

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/crystal.jpg)

The Major System and Dominic System are mnemonic systems for remembering number sequences. The Majoric System combines these two systems with the purpose of making it more flexible than the Dominic system and with a more intuitive letter ordering and rule logic compared to the Major system.

## Dominic System

The Dominic system was invented by memory champion, Dominic O'Brien. It assigns the initials and name of a memorable person or character, to a two digit number from 00 to 99.

## Dominic character positions
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  s  g  h  n  o
```

This uses alphabetical ordering, except for letters s, n and o.

## Major System

The Major System replaces numbers with consonant sounds. The system is very
powerful and complex.

## Major character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
t  n  m  r  l  j  c  v  p  s
d              sh k  f  b  z
th             ch g  ph
                  q
                  ck
```

## Combine Dominic System and Major System

Taking inspiration from the Dominic System, start with an alphabetical ordering for the first 9 Letters. Unlike the Major system, vowels are significant.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i
```

Next, where theres no conflict, add the Major system letter groupings on top of this alphabetical ordering.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k     l  v           z
      q
```

Finally, taking into account letter frequencies, make up reasons why the remaining letters are placed.

* The letter n is the first letter of nine.
* Lower case r looks like a mirror image of 7.
* Lower case m looks like an incomplete 8 on its side.
* The letter w has four lines forming it.
* The letter o looks like a 0.
* The letter u looks like a v.
* The letter j goes with the g.
* The letter x is mostly pronounced with a ks sound.
* The letter y is unassigned and dosen't change the number value of a word.

## Majoric character positions

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  s
t  p  k  w  l  v  r  m  n  z
      q        u  j        o
      x
```

## Majoric - Basic Word Rules

1. When a consonant grouping occurs that modifies the sound of the initial letter (e.g. br, ck, cl, gr, ll, mm, sh, st, ...), only the first letter is significant. Thus the word "ball" encodes 21 (not 211) and the word "crash" encodes number 30 (not 3708).
2. Vowels, a e i o u, are significant, but, only when they start a word and, in most cases, only the first vowel. (e.g age is 17, not 175).

Note: Rule 1 evens out the spread of words for the second digit.

## Majoric - Advanced Word Rules

3. Pluralising a word will change the number encoding. For example if you are
   visualising a cat vs a number of cats. (i.e. cat is 31 and cats is 310)
4. Prefixes starting with "un" are very common and treated as a single 6. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "unify" is encoded as 696 and "unborn" is encoded as 627.
5. Prefixes starting with "in" are very common and treated as a single 9. The letter after the prefix is significant. Thus "inability" is encoded as 91251.

## Majoric - Name, Action, Object Rules (for 2 digit numbers)

5. Names are created in the same ways as the Dominic system, with the first
  letter of the names (i.e. first and last name) representing a one digit number (and thus a two digit number when combined).
6. Actions and objects are created in a similar way as the Major system,
but with words of any length.
Only the first two significant letters are used, when actions and objects are being associated with a person representing a two digit number (as is the case in the example below).

## Generating Names

[Generate Names by initials](http://peoplebyinitials.com/p/dominic-number-memory-system)

## Majoric Example

I'm going to limit the example to the following letters to generate peoples names.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  n  s
```

Thus, apart from letters n and s, all letters are in alphabetical ordering. This
is for the names only. The actions and objects can use all available letters.

For example, the actor Sandra Bullock StaBilises OBelisk, encodes 02. The word
"obelisk" encodes 02 (rather than 0250) in this instance, because it's linked to Sandra Bullock and in a 2 digit naming convention (same for the word stabilises). If we were using a 3 digit naming convention, it would encode 3 digits!

My apologies to anyone I offend with the actions on objects :)
