title: Majoric System English List - 000 to 999
---

This is a list of words for the Majoric System, which is a cross between the
Major System and Dominic System.

You can use this list to pair words to names (like in the Dominic System), using
two digit or three digit numbers.  For example, If you are looking
for 01, you can use words from 010 to 019. (e.g You can choose the word "steers"
and only encode the first two relevant characters STeers)

note: This is not a list for the Major System, as the letter mappings and
logic rules are different!
