title: Dominic System J
---
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/crystal.jpg)

The Dominic system is a mnemonic system for remembering number sequences. It was invented by memory champion, Dominic O'Brien. It assigns the initials and name of a memorable person or character, to a two digit number from 00 to 99.

## Alphabetical number positions
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  i  J
k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  S  t
u  v  w  x  y  z
```

## Standard Dominic number positions
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
A  B  C  D  E  S  G  H  N  O
```

The Dominic system uses O for 0; S for 6; N for 9;

This doesn't work for me.
The letter O is the right shape, but, makes for some difficult name choices.
I don't agree with the choice of S, as the 6th letter (though, I do think it should be included).

## Changes from the Standard Dominic System

I want letters that are common as the first letter of famous peoples names, and as much as possible, indicate the numeric position in the alphabet.

* 0 - J (10th letter of alphabet and I like the name choices that can be
  generated)
* 6 - F (6th letter of alphabet and I'm Ok with the names generated)
* 9 - S (19th letter of alphabet and, generates good name choices. It makes me think "seven of nine". S is also useful to represent the card suit "Spades")

Thus, apart from "S", all letters are in their natural ordering:

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  S  J
```

This is different from simple letter frequencies would suggest. For instance I is a common letter, but for me, doesn't generate good name choices. In addition, J is extremely uncommon, but for me, generates consistently memorable names.

# Generating Names

[Generate Names by initials](http://peoplebyinitials.com/p/dominic-number-memory-system)

# Actions and Objects

I've tried to choose actions and objects that are as specific, narrow as
possible and have little overlap in the concept they use.

I've chosen to have the actions and objects have the initial letter constrained
in the same way that the names are. Obviously, this makes it a lot harder to
generate meaningful examples in the first place, but once they are generated,
they reinforce their name and number.

In the case of the letter J, as it is rare, I generate the Actions and Objects
using the letter T, which is the 20th letter of the alphabet. You might ask, why
not use T for the name. The answer is, I like the names generated by
J better and J looks like it forms half a 0.

Disclaimer: I am not a memory expert, and I don't claim this methodology is
better than anyone elseâ€™s (especially a champion mnemonist). It's a personal choice, thats all. I have previously tried the Major system and was unsuccessful in applying it.

## Example

In most cases the actions and objects have meaning to me, though the link to the
person/character may be tenuous.

My apologies to anyone I offend :) It really is a stretch coming up with
meaningful examples given the constraints.

## Cards

Experimental: the letter W is the 13 letter of the alphabet, so I've used it as well as the third letter C. I use a similar logic for letter N, R and I.
