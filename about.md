I'm a software developer who has an interest in big data programming with Apache
Spark. I mostly use Scala as my language of choice for this. I'm ok with Java,
especially Java 8.

I do some iOS development and prefer to use Swift over
Objective C. I've done some Android development too.

I use IntelliJ, AppCode and Xcode and with a Vim plugin. Vim just makes it a bit
easier to flip between different IDE's.
